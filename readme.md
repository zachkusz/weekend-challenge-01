## Weekend Project 1
Zach Kusz, April 30, 2016.

* This project represents our first use of dynamicly populating a website with
user submitted info.
* Users enter information into form fields.
* jQuery then prevents the submit form from contacting a server and instead
handles the data itself.
* Delete button clears the last from entry, but does not update the total cost.
